In springâ€™s embrace, the colors sing,  
A symphony that paints the wing.  
The dawn awakes with hues so bright,  
A tapestry of pure delight.  

The meadow blooms with yellows gold,  
Where daffodils their trumpets hold.  
With blush of pink, the cherry trees,  
Release their petals to the breeze.  

The azure sky, a boundless dome,  
Where swallows dart and find their home.  
Their feathers gleam in morning light,  
A blur of motion, swift and bright.  

The robins chirp in ruby red,  
With every note, the winter's shed.  
Amidst the green, the warblers flit,  
In canopies where shadows sit.  

The tulips rise in scarlet rows,  
Their colors like a flame that grows.  
Beside them, violets shyly peek,  
In lilac hues that softly speak.  

The palette of the earth renews,  
In every drop of morning dews.  
And birds, in chorus, sing the song,  
Of springtime's glory, bright and long.  

Oh, spring, your colors blend and flow,  
With every bird, the beauty shows.  
In vibrant tones and melodies,  
The world awakes to spring's reprise.
