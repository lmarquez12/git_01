## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  


## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
"To come and spoil the fun."  
      
      
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In spring’s embrace, the colors sing,  
A symphony that paints the wing.  
The dawn awakes with hues so bright,  
A tapestry of pure delight.  

The meadow blooms with yellows gold,  
Where daffodils their trumpets hold.  
With blush of pink, the cherry trees,  
Release their petals to the breeze.  

The azure sky, a boundless dome,  
Where swallows dart and find their home.  
Their feathers gleam in morning light,  
A blur of motion, swift and bright.  

The robins chirp in ruby red,  
With every note, the winter's shed.  
Amidst the green, the warblers flit,  
In canopies where shadows sit.  

The tulips rise in scarlet rows,  
Their colors like a flame that grows.  
Beside them, violets shyly peek,  
In lilac hues that softly speak.  

The palette of the earth renews,  
In every drop of morning dews.  
And birds, in chorus, sing the song,  
Of springtime's glory, bright and long.  

Oh, spring, your colors blend and flow,  
With every bird, the beauty shows.  
In vibrant tones and melodies,  
The world awakes to spring's reprise.
